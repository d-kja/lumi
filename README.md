# Simple PDF extraction

It's a simple app to extract data from a PDF file and store the data for later use. It's public due to the fact that it was written using concepts such as Factories, Clean Arch, and SOLID. It has nothing special in terms of features and it was solely made for the purpose of a job challenge.

Oh yes, I'm aware that the left-hook configuration isn't going to work as this project was made using 2 separate repositories and once it was finished, it was merged into one for the sake of make it easy to access. TL;DR: it wasn't meant to work in a singular repo.
